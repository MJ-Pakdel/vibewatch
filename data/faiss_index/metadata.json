After Henry's arm is broken while trying to catch a baseball at school, the tendon in that arm heals too tightly, allowing Henry to throw pitches that are as fast as 103 mph. Henry is spotted at nearby Wrigley Field by Larry \"Fish\" Fisher, the general manager of the struggling Chicago Cubs, after Henry throws an opponent's home-run ball all the way from the outfield bleachers back to the catcher, and it seems that Henry may be the pitcher that team owner Bob Carson has been praying for.",

Constantly surrounded by security officers, restricted in movements and having almost every waking moment carefully monitored makes normalcy an impossibility. No one knows this better than young Luke Davenport, the son of U.S. President Davenport. He vents his loneliness, frustration and feelings of isolation from family and friends by being a brat to his private Secret Service agent. When the agent snaps from the strain in front of the First Lady, a new agent is assigned to Luke. He turns out to be the enormous Sam Simms, a bit of a rogue who managed to rise through the ranks by sheer determination rather than strict adherence to Secret-Service protocol. At first, Luke tries all his old tricks upon Sam. But instead of getting angry, Sam seems to actually understand.",

In those days, Soft Machine symbolized the uncompromising dialog between those rock and jazz musicians who were determined to create a synthesis of the untamed energy of rock and the improvisational thrust of jazz. Forty years later, The Soft Machine Legacy musicians have not forsaken their dreams. Immune to the leveling pressures of show biz, Hugh Hopper, John Marshall, John Etheridge and Elton Dean -who passed away shortly after this last reunion at the New Morning - still mesmerize their fans. Whether the cheeks be rosy, or the heads speckled with grey freedom is ageless.  Recorded live at the New Morning, Paris on December 12th, 2005 by New Morning Vision.",

Donald soon realizes what they are up to, and sets out a box propped up with a stick. It's a crude trap, with an acorn as bait; but it's not too crude to fool Dale, who upsets it and traps Chip. Soon, Donald finds he can have fun instigating a fight between these two quarrelsome chipmunks, but he underestimates their friendship and their ability to work as a team against a common enemy: in this case, a bad-tempered duck.",

Pulp science fiction comics of the time are parodied. Life on other planets is considered, profiling each of the planets in the solar system from the perspective of what would happen to man on them.  A masterpiece of animation and sci-fi that was way ahead of it's time. Ward Kimball was perhaps the most inventive of all Disney animators and probably the only one who admitted to experimenting with psychedelic drugs in the 60's. Also the only animator who Walt Disney ever called a \"genius.\"",

In those days, Soft Machine symbolized the uncompromising dialog between those rock and jazz musicians who were determined to create a synthesis of the untamed energy of rock and the improvisational thrust of jazz. Forty years later, The Soft Machine Legacy musicians have not forsaken their dreams.

Whether the cheeks be rosy, or the heads speckled with grey freedom is ageless.  Recorded live at the New Morning, Paris on December 12th, 2005 by New Morning Vision.",
